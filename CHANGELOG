    - Complete change of the clock generation
        Adding the "ECS-2200BX-500" crystal oscillator
            You will now be able to select : 50MHz 
            or pre-division : /2, /4, /8, /16, /32, /64, /128, /256, /512, /1024, /2048, /4096, /8192, /16384, /32768, /65536
        Removing "~GLOBAL_CLK"
        More simple frequency control (switch to parallel control)
        Removing "LTC6903" (SPI frequency chip)
        Fixing unstable frequency change
        After a frequency change, the system now send a "SOURCE_RESET" pulse
        - Replacing "SN74LV163A" with "CD74AC161"
            Async reset
