    - Replacing all hidden power pins symbols (hidden pins bug)
    - Renaming "Main connector" to "SPS1 Processor connector"
    - Removing old symbols, cleaning
    - Replacing symbol "CD74AC238" with a new one
    - Replacing all used 74x1Gxx symbols
        (shared power pin fix, and visual)

- SCHEMATICS FEATURES
    - Complete change of the clock generation
        Adding the "ECS-2200BX-500" crystal oscillator
            You will now be able to select : 50MHz 
            or pre-division : /2, /4, /8, /16, /32, /64, /128, /256, /512, /1024, /2048, /4096, /8192, /16384, /32768, /65536
        Removing "~GLOBAL_CLK"
        More simple frequency control (switch to parallel control)
        Removing "LTC6903" (SPI frequency chip)
        Fixing unstable frequency change
        After a frequency change, the system now send a "SOURCE_RESET" pulse
        - Replacing "SN74LV163A" with "CD74AC161"
            Async reset
        - Put a Tpd delay to "ADDSRC_CLK"
        - "ADDSRC_CLK" is now directly connected to the CLK input of the 24bits counter

    - Renaming "ClockGenerator.sch" sheet to "fileClockGenerator.sch"

    - Adding a seperate clock signal only for peripheral (PClockGenerator)
    
    - Applying PP1 standard for peripheral https://github.com/JonathSpirit/GComputer_standard
    - Applying MM1 standard for memory https://github.com/JonathSpirit/GComputer_standard
    
    - Mounting holes is now on schematics
    
    - Renaming "MAIN_RESET" to "POWER_RESET"
    - Renaming "SOURCE_RESET" to "LIGHT_RESET"
    - Renaming "RESET_CLK" to "GLOBAL_RESET"
    
    - MemoryController rework
        User can now control CE,WE,OE pins of the not selected memory source
        Applying MM1 standard, (3.3V)
