## Issues
Thank you for your interest in my project,
if you want to ask any questions, report a problem or simply make a suggestion for a new idea (or modification) to be implemented in the project you will be able to create "Issues".

There are no bad or good suggestions, we are here to discuss them in a friendly way. Please do not insult or try to force the implementation of your idea.
I reserve the right to refuse any suggestion if it does not fit the project.

Please, make sure that any issue you are going to send does not already exist in order to avoid duplication.

For a better understanding of all, please write all types of text in English.

### Create an issue

2) Write a good, not too long, title that represent your issue (you can write the type of your issue ("bug", "question", ...) at the begining).

3) Make sure that your comment describe an maximum of information (image can help too).

4) Preview your issue before submiting it.

5) Submit your issue.

After some time, I will put a label to your issue, respond to it and eventually take a decision.
I am personally not available 24 hours a day (this also applies to most people), please be patient.

I am not the only one who can answer the various questions/suggestions, you too can take part in a discussion and give your opinion.
